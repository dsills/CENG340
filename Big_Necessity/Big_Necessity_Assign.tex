\title {\textbf{The Big Necessity -- Blog Posts}}
\author {Deborah Sills}
%\date {9 February 2013}
\maketitle

\section *{Learning Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Develop an appreciation of the impact of civil \& environmental engineering on society and the environment.
\item Engage in an intellectual discussion with your peers about the topics raised by the author.
\end{enumerate}

\section *{Rationale}
In her book \emph{The Big Necessity, the World of Human Waste and Why it's important}, Rose George covers a wide range of topics.  These range from the sewers of London, to open defecation in the slums of , and the ``most expensive toilet in the world,'' which was constructed for the Space Station.  I chose this book, because almost all of the chapters (except, perhaps, the one about the fancy Japanese toilets) remind me of how civil and environmental engineers have improved our lives, but, on the other hand, the problems that current environmental engineering designs don't address.

\section *{Assignment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write three blog posts (300 words each) on three chapters of your choice.  In each case, you should address at least two of the following prompts:

\begin{itemize}
\item How did the environmental engineering technology described in this chapter change peoples live?
\item How did the engineering technology described in this chapter protect the environment?
\item Imagine the world without the technology described in this chapter.
\end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}
