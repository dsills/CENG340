Ruth George really grabs the reader with her introduction.

As a new professor in a civil and environmental engineering department I couldn't help but feel proud that civil engineers have had such a positive improvement on human health

I find it incredible that so many people have cell phones but so few have a safe place to go to the bathroom. I also wonder why we can't come up with a design that is cheap and implementenable enough so everyone in the world has access to a  toilet.  I've heard many engineering professors state that it's not an engineering problem, that we know how to treat human waste, that we've been doing it for a long time, and that the problems economic and social.

I have to disagree.
