\item \emph{(10 pts)} \textbf{Sedimentation:}\\
\emph{Adapted from Mackenzie and Davis} The town of San Jose has an existing horizontal-flow sedimentation tank with an overflow rate of 17 $\mathrm{\frac{m^3}{d\times m^2}}$.  The plant operator wants to remove particles that have settling velocities of 0.1 mm/s, 0.2 mm/s, and 1 mm/s.  What percentage of removal should be expected for each particle in an ideal sedimentation tank.

\item \emph{(11 pts)} Disinfection
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equivalent percent reduction for a 2.5 log reduction of \emph{Giardia lambia}? 

\item What is the log reduction that is equivalent to 99.96 percent reduction?
\end{enumerate}	

\item Prepare a conceptual design of a water treatment facility to meet the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\item Design capacity = 3.25 MGD
\item Source is river water, at 10 $^0$C
\item Unit operations: coagulation (rapid mix), flocculation, sedimentation, rapid sand filtration, disinfection
\item Additional Constraints: units must be sized according to acceptable ranges.  Design must accommodate maintenance and repair.

\end{itemize}

Complete the design according to the following sequence:
