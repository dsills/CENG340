      <!--<h5>Course Overview</h5>
      
<p>Topics to be covered in this course include: physical, chemical & biological fundamentals that govern the fate and transport of pollutants in the environment, as well as the design of water and wastewater treatment systems; an analysis of engineering design using principles of Green Engineering, and sustainability issues in the developing world.</p>



<p>From Julie Zimmerman:  Topics will range from sources to meet current water needs for human consumption, industry, agriculture, recreation and ecosystem services, and the state of these sources under future scenarios of status quo, global warming, population growth, and the industrialization of developing nations. The course will also cover the fundamentals of water chemistry, the current design of water and wastewater treatment and distribution systems, an analysis of these designs through Green Engineering, and innovations for future designs including providing services without significant infrastructure.</p>-->

<h2>Course Goals</h2>


 <ul> 
  <li>Integrate and apply relevant content from previous courses---chemistry, fluid mechanics, calculus, and statistics---to formulate and solve environmental engineering problems.</li>
  <li>Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.</li>
  <li>Apply the principles of material and energy balances to analyze environmental problems.</li> 
  <li>Understand the fundamental factors that affect the selection, design, and operation of pollution treatment technologies.</li>
  <li>Identify appropriate technologies for treatment of specific pollutants present in water, soil, and air.</li>
  <li>Design basic components of water and wastewater treatment reactors.</li>
  <li>Analyze engineering designs through the principles of Green Engineering.</li>
  <li>Develop an appreciation of the impact of civil & environmental engineering on society and the environment.</li>
  <li>Improve your ability to present and analyze experimental data. </li>
  <li>Improve your ability to communicate technical information in both written and oral form.</li>
  <li>Develop an appreciation of the value of independent learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Course Material</h2>
<h4>From the Catalog</h4>
<p>An introduction to the fundamentals of environmental engineering and science such as chemistry, microbiology, mass balance, and reactor theory. Application of fundamental concepts to environmental engineering includes water quality, water and wastewater treatment, solid and hazardous waste, air pollution, greenhouse gases and climate change. This course includes hands-on laboratory component with a focus on experiential learning. Prerequisite: ENGR 222 or permission of the instructor.</p>

<h4>My take</h4>
<p>This course will cover basic fundamental topics as dicussed in the catalog description.  But this course is also an opportunity for us to look critically at some of humanity's big problems.  For example, here in the U.S., we face challenges associated with crumbling, out-of-date civil and environmental engineering infrastructure, and, in certain regions, looming problems of water scarcity. Worldwide, 2.5 billion people lack sanitation and xx billion lack safe drinking water.  And to make things even more interesting, climate change is expected to exacerbate some of the these problems.  I hope that over this semester we can begin to formulate ways engineers might analyze these problems and come up with innovative designs and solutions.  

  look critically at the current design of water and wastewater treatment and distribution systems, an analysis of these designs through Green Engineering, and innovations for future designs including providing services without significant infrastructure. </p>

<h2>Required Background</h2>

<p>CHEM 201 General Chemistry I<br>
    ENGR 222 Fluid Mechanics<br>
    Math 202 Calculus II<br>
    Math 226 Statistics for Engineers</p>

<p>A solid understanding of many of the concepts covered in the prerequisite courses is helpful and often necessary for this course.  You are expected to review this material independently as needed, but please ask me (via email or in person) for guidance if you're struggling. </p>

<p>The lab sessions are designed to ... Lab sessions will be held in the Environmental Lab --Dana 201--and . There <strong>will</strong> be a lab in the first week. To participate in the labs, ...</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Homework</strong> -- <strong>10%</strong> Starting in the second week homeworks will handed in to your TA at the start of your lab session (there will be 9 graded homeworks total).  No late homeworks will be accepted unless you made arrangements with me prior to the due date.  Late homeworks will not receive full credit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exam 1</strong> -- <strong>20%</strong> of final grade.  The midterm will cover chapters 1 through 4 and be held Wednesday, <strong>October 31st</strong>, during the usual lecture time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exam 2</strong> -- <strong>20%</strong> of final grade.  The midterm will cover chapters 5 through 8 and be held Wednesday, <strong>November 31st</strong>, during the usual lecture time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final</strong> -- <strong>25%</strong> of final grade. The final will be cumulative and be held Monday <strong>December 3rd</strong> at 1200.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Laboratory</strong> <strong>20%</strong> of final grade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participation</strong> <strong>5%</strong> of final grade.</p></li>

<h2>Classroom culture</h2>

<p>If you would rather be sleeping, reading the newspaper, messaging your friends, facebooking, tweeting, shopping or gaming I suggest you do it somewhere more comfortable than the classroom.  Please don't use laptops during class (I find it rude) unless we need laptops for a specific exercise---Thank you! </p>

<h2>Academic responsibility</h2>

<p>Students are expected to abide by the principles clearly explained in the Student Handbook and to act in accordance with Bucknell University's Honor Code presented below. Under no circumstance, should any student submit work that is not of his or her authorship. If a deadline is tight or impossible, don't get desperate, instead, talk to your instructor.

Your instructor will explain in detail the collaboration policy for each specific assignment. Before you start your work, make sure to read and understand this policy. Should any questions arise, contact your instructor immediately to have them clarified..</p>

<h3>Bucknell University Honor Code</h3>

<blockquote><p>Bucknell students are responsible for the preparation and presentation of work representing their own efforts. Acceptance
of this responsibility is essential to the educational process and must be considered as an expression of mutual trust, the
foundation upon which creative scholarship rests. Students are directed to use great care when preparing all written work
and to acknowledge fully the source of all ideas and language other than their own.</p>

<p>As a student and citizen of the Bucknell University community:</p>
<ul>
  <li> I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors.</li>
  <li> I will forthrightly oppose each and every instance of academic dishonesty.</li>
  <li> I will let my conscience guide my decision to communicate directly with any person or persons I believe to have been dishonest in academic work.</li>
  <li> I will let my conscience guide my decision on reporting breaches of academic integrity to the appropriate faculty or deans.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<h2>Disability statement</h2>

<p>Accommodations are collaborative efforts between students, faculty and Bucknell's Disability Services. Students with approved accommodations should contact me during the first two weeks of the semester to discuss accommodations. Students who believe they are eligible for accommodations but who have not yet obtained approval should contact the Associate Dean of Engineering at (570-xxxxx) .  Refer to <a href: "https://www.bucknell.edu/campus-life/disability-services-and-resources/faqs.html">Bucknell's FAQ about disability services</a> if you have questions, or contact me---by email or in person.</p>
